<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is my solution to a command line pomodoro timer. However, I sought to combine the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) with data science to track:
1. Amount of hours studied (time tracked after each successful pomodoro)
2. Streaks (streaks update per day on using the app)
3. Overall stats like max amount of hours studied for the day, mean, etc. There's even a line chart you can create! 

These stats are displayed using **Numpy** and **MatPlotLib**.

### Built With

- This project was built purely with **Python**.
- Data is stored inside a `.csv` file. (Default = `pomo_data.csv`)
- Some python packages used to create this:
   1. Numpy + Matplotlib: for displaying stats
   2. Colorama: to prettify the text
   3. playsound: play the alarm and break sound

## Roadmap

Currently, this is the final product. However, I am using this as my daily pomodoro timer, so I may tweak a few things as I see fit.
